env_ma_get_space_peak() die den space peak in Bytes zur"uckliefern.

mrege genericfilenames into fbsadv, and finally replace genericfilename
by genfilename (if not too slow).

--------------------

store the special code information on a file and perform
prefixlength many iterations to insert the suffixes: PRIO-low

show space of different parts relative to all parts: PRIO-high

use flexible fixed bits type to store integers: PRIO low

use test sequence of length n where n % 4 \in [0,1,2,3]

instead of determining the parts, the user should define a
maximum amount of memory to be used. Then the number of
parts are chosen such that this boundary is not exceeded.

add advancement display, see Gordon's lib: 0% 1% ... 100%

Sometimes I cannot set a default value when specifying the option,
because the default value is determined after all other options
are known and maybe some file is input

replacing timer by some method which does not produce overflows.

use encseq->totallength instead of the parameter totallength in
bentleysedgewick

output the ranges in sorted order w.r.t. the length

replace readnextline by str_read_next_line
