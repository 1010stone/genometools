store the special code information on a file and perform
prefixlength many iterations to insert the suffixes: PRIO-low

show space of different parts relative to all parts: PRIO-high

add type Sequencelength: allows for small and large sequences in 32 bit mode.
unsigned long in 64-bit mode: PRIO low

use flexible fixed bits type to store integers: PRIO low

use test sequence of length n where n % 4 \in [0,1,2,3]

do not force -pl to be a mandatory argument, if left out, then
it determined automatically.

instead of determining the parts, the user should define a
maximum amount of memory to be used. Then the number of
parts are chosen such that this boundary is not exceeded.

add advancement display, see Gordon's lib: 0% 1% ... 100%

implement distribution via hashtables or red-black trees.

check why the program reports 0.61 bits/symbol for the human genome

Sometimes I cannot set a default value when specifying the option,
because the default value is determined after all other options
are known and maybe some file is input

replacing timer by some method which does not produce overflows.

use encseq->totallength instead of the parameter totallength

output the ranges in sorted order w.r.t. the length
