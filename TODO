bugs:
-----

- does not compile on Mac OS X 10.3 (glob(3) is not fully POSIX compliant)
- is the name for the StrArray class misleading (it does not contain Strs)?


feature requests:
-----------------

- implement skiplist class
- replace msort() routine with a routine covered by LICENSE
- replace the st (hashtable) implementation with own implementation
- replace sscanf calls
- consensus_sa: fuzzlength, undetermined strand
- glob() -> fnmatch()
- coverage tests
- use tool from tridge to find functions which are are not used
- write check script to check for error_check()
- EXIT_SUCCESS und EXIT_FAILURE only in gtr.c and gt.c
- no exit() calls inside library
- fix queue implementation
- write extractseq tool
- update design.html, describe interface inheritance
- check random number generation
- range check
- check for circles
- `gt eval`: measure nucleotide level
- extend error messages for xmalloc(), xcalloc(), and xrealloc(): show requested
  memory sizes and maybe line number and file name)

- remove GT_ENV_OPTIONS environment variable, do settings via gtdata/ dir


view tool:
----------

- handle overlapping children more conveniently
- check for tree properties of input data
- add (full) Lua bindings
- allow to specify the ``type order'' of tracks in config file
- allow multiple files as input to `gt view` (as discussed with Sascha):
  - each track has a filename (additionally to the type)
  - allow to sort tracks by type and then by filename (in the order specified
    on the command line) or the other way round (one is the default, one is
    switched on by a command line option)


BitPackArray/BitPackClass:
--------------------------

- use naming conventions (e.g., bitpackarray_new instead of newBitPackArray)
