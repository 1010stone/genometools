Building GenomeTools
--------------------

Invoke GNU make, e.g.:

$ make [argument ...] 

to build GenomeTools.

On *BSD GNU make is often called ``gmake''.
Possible arguments:

- opt=no to disable optimization
- assert=no to disable assertions

Example call to build GenomeTools without assertions on a system where GNU make
is called ``gmake'':

$ gmake assert=no


Testing GenomeTools (optional)
------------------------------

Call

$ make test

to make sure your GenomeTools build went fine.
This step requires an installed Ruby interpreter (see 
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ for informations on Ruby).


Installing GenomeTools
----------------------

To install the ``gt'' binary and the ``libgt'' library (plus header files) on
your system invoke

$ make install

Per default the files are installed under /usr/local
You can change this with the prefix argument. For example, to install under
/usr invoke

# make prefix=/usr
