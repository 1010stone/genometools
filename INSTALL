Building GenomeTools
--------------------

Invoke GNU make, e.g.:

$ make [argument ...]

to build GenomeTools. You need at least version 3.80 of GNU make, you can check
which version you have by invoking

$ make --version

On *BSD GNU make is often called ``gmake''.

Possible arguments:

- opt=no to disable optimization
- assert=no to disable assertions

Example call to build GenomeTools without assertions on a system where GNU make
is called ``gmake'':

$ gmake assert=no


Building GenomeTools without the curses library:
------------------------------------------------

On systems without an installed curses library invoke make as above with the
argument curses=no

If you invoked make without curses=no beforehand, do not forget to run `make
clean` before running `make curses=no`.


Building GenomeTools without the sketch tool (if Cairo is not installed):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

invoke make as above with the argument cairo=no


Building GenomeTools as a Univeral Binary (on Mac OS X):
--------------------------------------------------------

invoke make as above with the argument universal=yes


Testing GenomeTools (optional)
------------------------------

Call

$ make test

to make sure your GenomeTools build went fine.
This step requires an installed Ruby interpreter (see
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ for informations on Ruby).


Installing GenomeTools
----------------------

To install the ``gt'' binary and the ``libgenometools'' library
(plus header files) on your system invoke

$ make install

Per default the files are installed under /usr/local
You can change this with the prefix argument. For example, to install under
/usr invoke

# make prefix=/usr install


Final note
-----------

Please look at http://genometools.org for updates and report bugs if you
encounter any.

Enjoy!
