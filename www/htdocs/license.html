<p>
Our copyright policy is modelled after the one of the
<a href="http://openbsd.org/policy.html">OpenBSD</a> operating system.
We chose one of the most simple and free licenses, the ICS license.
It is functionally equivalent to a two-term BSD copyright with
language removed that is made unnecessary by the Berne convention. 
</p>
<p>
To ensure that <i>GenomeTools</i> remains absolutly free, <b>we will only accept
contributions which have been put under this license</b>.
